I'm still seeing the following issues that will need to be fixed:

    * Floated images don't clear correctly

   2. I'm attaching a screenshot of what I'm currently seeing on your site when a floated image is the last thing on a page or post. Notice how the "edit page" link, comments box, etc. are kind of hanging out next to the image? What we want instead is for the image to be at the end of the page content, and then have all that other stuff come below, as if it were a new section (which it is). After the post content, but before the categories, tags, etc, add:

       <div style="clear:both;"></div>


    * No permalink is provided when the post title is absent 

   3. The permalink is, again, not automatic - by default, the title provides a permalink to the post, but when someone posts without a title, you should provide some kind of fallback for readers. Many people do this by making the post date clickable, but others prefer something that explicitly says "permalink" or "link to this post" or something like that. The details are up to you. 

THEME FUNCTIONALITY:

    * I see that you've added nav_menu support to the code, but choosing a menu doesn't actually change anything.
    * For your header image, please use core custom header support rather than asking users to directly upload an image. 

   4. The image header is your choice - there's no requirement to include custom header functionality at all, but there is a requirement to use core functionality if you allow a header to be uploaded. To be honest, the current system doesn't prevent anyone from uploading something that wouldn't fit the design anyway - and it does create issues for blog owners who can't upload directly.
